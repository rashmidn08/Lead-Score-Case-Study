Logistic Regression Modelling Steps:

Step 1: Import necessary libraries
Step 2: Read & understand data
Step 3: Data Cleaning
Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis: Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate analysis.
Step 5: Data Pre-processing
Step 6: Data Preparation: Train-Test Split, Missing Value Imputation, Outlier Treatment, Dummy Variable Creation, Scaling continuous variables
Step 7: Modelling: Feature selection, Model Building
Step 8: Model Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Sensitivity, Precision, F1 Score, 
        Finding Optimal cut-off: ROC curve, Precision- Recall Trade-off
        Apply on test set
Step 9: Calculate Lead Score
